# 68000AssemblyGame
This is a two-player game made using the 68000 Assembly language. 
This is a demonstration of low-level data manipulation to create a structured program.

The assets, including audio, were sourced through Envato Elements with my subscription. 

The program was written using an emulator for the Motorola 68000 called Easy68K.

Below is the description of the project found within the main Assembly file.

 Description: Game Name - SPACE JUNKERS
               In this game you play as one of two character, you are either JERRY JUNKER (Player 1, WASD) or GARY GARBAGE (Player 2,IJKL).
               The premise of the game is that you are space-garbage collectors that are in a competition to see who can catch the most falling
               space-garbage. The garbage (In-code referref to as "Messages") is being pulled in by an force beam that increases its pull over time.
               As such, the speed of the falling garbage will increase more and more over time until the beam reaches full power (In-program, until we hit Terminal Velocity).
               The game also includes a few voice lines as well.
               I will continue by describing how this game meets each of the requirements.

               1. "User input control of game entity (i.e. paddle in Pong, aiming a turret, etc)"
                   This is addressed by allowing the players to catch the garbage as it falls. They control when it is collected/attempted to be collected.

               2. "Bitmap background with entities moving around over it"
                   This is addressed through the rendering of the messages in the game. As they fall, the redraw the background of their previous location.

               3. "Physics update of game entity, including acceleration (gravity would be good example)"
                   The speed of the messages is determined by a fixed Acceleration that gradually increases the velocity over time until it hits Terminal Velocity.

               4."Fixed point math"
                   This requirement is fulfilled when doing the calculations for velocity each frame. The Velocity increases by less than one pixel-unit per frame, but
                   this change is only noticeable once the Velocity increases past 1 once it is shifted down.

               5. "Collision detection between game entities"
                   The messages are constantly having their position polled. The program can detect when a message reaches it's lowest point possible and will despawn it.
                   The program also polls the position of the messages when the messages' corresponding button is pressed to determine whether or not the player has scored and how much.

               6. "A score indicator as a 7-segment LED"
                   The 7-Segment LED is used as a timer.

               7. "Randomness"
                   I use a slightly modified version of the Random code provided to us for use. I additionally use the third byte of data from the right of what is returned as my random value.
                   This does rely on time, so ultimately it does end up following a noticeable pattern, however the very first time is random in that it is entirely dependent on what time you play at.

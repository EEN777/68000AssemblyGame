# 68000AssemblyGame
This is a two-player game made using the 68000 Assembly language. 
This is a demonstration of low-level data manipulation to create a structured program.

The assets, including audio, were sourced through Envato Elements with my subscription. 

The program was written using an emulator for the Motorola 68000 called Easy68K.
